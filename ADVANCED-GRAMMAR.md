| **whom** | People (object) | The man **whom** I saw |
| **whose** | Possession | The girl **whose** name is Mary |
| **which** | Things/animals | The book **which** I read |
| **that** | People/things (restrictive only) | The car **that** I bought |
| **where** | Places | The office **where** I work |
| **when** | Times | The day **when** I arrived |
| **why** | Reasons | The reason **why** I came |

---

### Types of Relative Clauses

- ✅ The office **where I work** is in Jakarta. (identifies which office)

#### 2. Non-Defining Relative Clauses (Extra Information)
- Adds extra information about a noun already identified
- WITH commas
- CANNOT use "that"
- MUST use "who/which"

**Examples**:

- ✅ This book, **which I bought yesterday**, is great. (extra info - book already identified)
- ✅ Jakarta, **where I was born**, is a big city. (extra info - Jakarta already known)

---

- ✅ The house **(that)** she bought is beautiful. (= The house she bought...)

**CANNOT Omit (Subject Position)**:
- ❌ The man **who** called me is my friend. (who = subject of relative clause, cannot omit)
- ❌ The book **which** is on the table is mine. (which = subject of relative clause, cannot omit)

---

### "Whose" (Possessive Relative Pronoun)
- Shows possession in relative clauses

**Examples**:

### Reduced Relative Clauses

Can omit relative pronoun + be verb in certain cases.

#### 1. Active Relative Clauses (Present Participle)

#### 2. Passive Relative Clauses (Past Participle)
